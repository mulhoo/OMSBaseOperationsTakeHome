# Base Operations Take Home Challenge

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version 22.8.0

### Installation
```bash
npm install
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Running the Application
```bash
npm run dev-full
```

Or run separately:
```bash
npm run dev
npm run frontend
```

I would add indexes on location and dates, since those will be the main two points I would be needing to query on.
